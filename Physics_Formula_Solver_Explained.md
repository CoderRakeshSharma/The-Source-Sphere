## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Mechanics

- **Newton's Second Law**: `F = m * a`  
  _Force (F) is the product of mass (m) and acceleration (a). This formula describes how much force is needed to move an object._

- **Kinetic Energy**: `KE = 0.5 * m * v¬≤`  
  _Kinetic Energy (KE) is the energy possessed by a moving object. It's proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity._

- **Gravitational Potential Energy**: `PE = m * g * h`  
  _Potential Energy (PE) is the stored energy due to an object‚Äôs position in a gravitational field. Here, g is the gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s¬≤), and h is height._

### 2. Electricity

- **Ohm's Law**: `V = I * R`  
  _Voltage (V) is the product of current (I) and resistance (R). It shows how voltage changes with current and resistance._

- **Electric Power**: `P = V * I`  
  _Power (P) in an electric circuit is calculated by multiplying voltage (V) and current (I)._

### 3. Thermodynamics

- **Heat Transfer**: `Q = m * c * ŒîT`  
  _Heat (Q) is the amount of energy transferred due to temperature difference. It depends on mass (m), specific heat capacity (c), and temperature change (ŒîT)._

### 4. Optics

- **Lens Formula**: `1/f = 1/v - 1/u`  
  _Relates the focal length (f) of a lens to the image distance (v) and object distance (u). Positive and negative signs depend on conventions._

### 5. Motion (Kinematics)

- **Final Velocity**: `v = u + a * t`  
  _Final velocity (v) is the initial velocity (u) plus the product of acceleration (a) and time (t)._

- **Distance**: `s = ut + 0.5 * a * t¬≤`  
  _Distance (s) covered under constant acceleration is a combination of initial motion and accelerated motion._

### 6. Waves

- **Wave Speed**: `v = f * Œª`  
  _Wave speed (v) is the product of frequency (f) and wavelength (Œª). Describes how fast a wave propagates._

### 7. Modern Physics

- **Photon Energy**: `E = h * f`  
  _Energy (E) of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency (f). Planck's constant (h = 6.626 x 10‚Åª¬≥‚Å¥ J¬∑s)._

### 8. Fluid Mechanics

- **Pressure**: `P = F / A`  
  _Pressure (P) is the force (F) applied per unit area (A)._

### 9. Magnetism

- **Magnetic Force**: `F = q * v * B * sin(Œ∏)`  
  _The force (F) on a moving charge (q) in a magnetic field (B), where v is the velocity and Œ∏ is the angle between v and B._

### 10. Relativity

- **Time Dilation**: `t' = t / ‚àö(1 - v¬≤ / c¬≤)`  
  _Time (t') observed in motion appears longer than time (t) measured at rest. This formula applies for velocities close to the speed of light (c = 3 x 10‚Å∏ m/s)._

## üß† How It Works

1. The program starts with a main menu listing all physics topics.
2. After selecting a topic, users are prompted to choose a formula or sub-concept.
3. The program asks for input values needed for the formula.
4. The formula is applied and the result is printed.
