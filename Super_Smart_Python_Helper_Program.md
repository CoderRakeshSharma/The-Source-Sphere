# 🧠 Super Smart Python Helper Program 🐍

Hey there! 👋  
This is a **Super Smart Python Program** that can do many cool things like math, shapes, temperature tricks, and number magic! ✨  
You just run it, and it talks to you like a friendly robot. 🤖

---

## 🚀 How to Start?

### 1. First, open your **Python** playground (your code editor).

### 2. Paste the code from `main.py` (that’s the smart robot).

### 3. Run the file.

### 4. Pick what you want it to do by pressing a letter. (Like A, B, C…)

---

## 🎮 What Can It Do?

Here are all the fun things this robot can do, explained super simply:

### A) 🧮 Basic Calculator

It can:

- ➕ Add
- ➖ Subtract
- ✖️ Multiply
- ➗ Divide
- // Whole divide (cut off the decimal)
- % Find remainder
- 🌱 Find square root
- \*\* Power (like 2 to the power 3 is 8)

---

### B) 📐 Trigonometric Calculator

It plays with angles! Like:

- sin
- cos
- tan
- and even fancy ones like cosec, sec, cot  
  Just type an angle in degrees, and it tells the magic number.

---

### C) 🔍 Number Check

It checks one number and tells:

- Is it a **prime number**? (Only divides by 1 and itself?)
- Is it a **palindrome**? (Reads same forward and backward)
- Is it **even or odd**?
- Is it an **Armstrong number**? (Some math magic!)

---

### D) 🔢 Number Range Fun

Pick a starting number and an ending number, then choose:

- 🐚 Fibonacci numbers
- 🧍 Even numbers
- 🏃 Odd numbers
- 👶 Natural numbers (starts from 1)
- 🎯 Prime numbers

---

### E) 🌡️ Temperature Converter

Convert between:

- Celsius (C)
- Fahrenheit (F)
- Kelvin (K)  
  So hot and cold makes sense in any world! 🌍🔥❄️

---

### F) 📏 Geometry Fun

It knows about:

- 🔲 Squares (area & border length)
- 🧱 Rectangles
- 🔺 Triangles (using Heron’s formula)
- 🟠 Circles (area & round line)

---

### G) 📐 Pythagoras Theorem Solver

You give 2 sides of a triangle, and it finds the 3rd one!

- Hypotenuse (longest side)
- Base
- Perpendicular  
  Math magic! 🔺✨

---

### H) 🔣 Number Theory Magic

More smart stuff:

- GCD (Biggest number that fits into both)
- LCM (Smallest number both numbers can go into)
- MOD (Remainder when you divide)

---

### Q) ❌ Quit

Say bye to the robot 🤖 and it will stop helping.

---

## 💡 Why Did I Make This?

Because sometimes you want to do **a lot of small mathy things** in one place.  
So I made one big robot that does it all. 🎯

---

## 📎 How to Run This?

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure Python is installed on your computer. 🐍💻
